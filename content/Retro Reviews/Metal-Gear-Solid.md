Very good but the last bit of the game was honestly kind of awful to play, albeit cool to experience. the final fist fight was easily the worst playing part of the whole game, second was the car segment right afterward. I have only started MGS2 at the time of writhing this but I'm pretty sure the fact that PS2 had an analog stick as the standard will make the game overall feel a lot better. All the other boss fights were a lot of fun, my favorite being the sniper wolf fights because I thought the detail of seeing her breath in the cold was really cool. The missable dialogue in general is always a cool touch, my favorite being MG2:Solid Snake References while fist fighting the "ninja"
