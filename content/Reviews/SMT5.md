I kind of ruined my experience by b-lining it to the ending and then being kind of under powered so I couldn't beat the last boss, but I plan to 100% the PC version when that's out. Other than that I love this game and it's ignited a love of the series for me. It really struggles on the switch though. My only other complaint is that most of the dungeons are kind of undercooked and boring.
