This game is to Titanfall (pilots only) what ULTRAKILL is to Doom. Easily top 3 indies that I played this year. By the end of the game its like your cheating. Echo Point Nova is the game that's in your head as a kid while you stare out the car window, imagining a surfing man doing flips and going as fast as you can imagine. This games pacing is a little strange, you become so strong/fast once you unlock more perks that the first boss is much harder than the rest. My favorite part of the game is the exploration, however, the goal is to skip as much of it as possible (positive) by moving as fast as you can. Echo Point Nova isn't a power fantasy it's a SPEED fantasy. Become a god by being as fast as possible. Game Mechanic SPOILER: The game really clicked for me once I got the Rocket Start Power up, which allows you to effectively parry the ground to get a huge speed boost.
