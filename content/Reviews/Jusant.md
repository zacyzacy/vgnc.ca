This game has great game feel. The way you move is incredibly intentional feeling and the climbing is very natural and precise. I enjoyed the time in the game but at a certain point I fell off and felt satisfied enough to stop playing and move on, despite not finishing the game. Not sure what the price of the game is but on gamepass this is an absolute must.
