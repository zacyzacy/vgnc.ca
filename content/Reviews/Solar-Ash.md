The art in this game is gorgeous, they completely nailed the transition from 2D to 3D, while keeping their artstyle. 
The platforming was trying to be fast but it has the "sonic problem" where the game doesn't know how to not slow you down constantly. The story was also awful. It starts out with a cool title card: "The Ultravoid is swallowing your planet; are you a bad enough dude to save the world?" I'm paraphrasing but the intro was short and sweet, but then all the characters keep talking for some reason and it really kills the vibe in a Marvel dialogue sort of way. Overall the sliding around feels nice but everything else is very subdued, game feel wise, which I thought was strange because Hyper light drifter was the opposite of that.
