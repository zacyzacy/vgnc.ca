I kept wanting to play the cool metroidvanias that are always coming out, but I never did because "I'd never played metroid", but this game looked really cool and was on sale on the eshop (I know right) so I picked it up and then started Zero Mission on NSO. I've now completed Metroid 1 through 5 and they're all pretty excellent.

I didn't expect to enjoy the story so much, in the whole series but particularly this one. Metroid Dread is a really great addition to the series and I hope they make more in this style, which I think they will based on the acquisition big N made.

It took me some time to get used to the analog aiming but we got there. I'm a big fan of parries in general, and this game is definitely full of parries almost to a fault. I never thought I'd say this, but I like the QTEs in this game they are snappy and just interactive enough. The pacing is excellent, and the difficulty ramps up perfectly with Samus' power.

This is very much "Metroid Fusion 2" and by that I mean the Vibes are really great, the scary enemies are scary and atmospheric and the game feels really great. They really capture the feeling of metroid fusion and zero mission and cranked it up to 11, Samus HAULS ASS in this game and it rules.
