Spoilers ahead I'm talking about the ending a lot. I love this game, the story and the characters are so great, but what really shines is the world & setting. I love the world so much, that when they started to reveal the nature of the paintress and the canvas, it started to lose me, but I came around by the end. I think the reveal of what the paintress is was a little rushed, and it really lessened the impact of a really cool line "the paintress was merely warning us".

My hang up in act 3 was that the adventures with Verso and friends"weren't real" because of how the canvas is. What brought me back was the realization that that's basically what the characters were feeling as well. In the end I felt it was "real" and all the people within the canvas have humanity.

The game really won me over with the whole family arc in the end and how their grief + power turned them into selfish evil god people.

I also wanted to mention a few things that don't really fit anywhere in my review:
Monoco is the coolest mother fucker ever.
False epilogue is super hype.
The sound track is a real stand out and genuinely one of the GOAT.
